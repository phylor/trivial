# My Trivial List

## Web Development

- [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com) Too much special syntax files, lots of magic, little entry-level documentation

## Programming and Scripting Languages

- [C++](https://isocpp.org) Although still used for high-performance tasks, the language itself feels overly-complex in today's world
- [C](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/) Okay for low-level programming, but the naming of its standard library is outdated
- [JavaScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) This is what happens if a language 'grows historically', have not seen good looking code yet
- [PHP](http://php.net) Not just the language's fault, has been used by many beginners without solid software engineering knowledge, leading to very bad and insecure production code
